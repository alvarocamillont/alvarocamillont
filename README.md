### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a software engineer, speaker and instructor in Brazil. I work in the technology industry for over 10 years dedicated to the development of business solutions in a Big Tech. I am a technology enthusiast and see knowledge sharing as an opportunity to help the community that helped me so much and the best way of learning. I believe in technology as a tool for empowering people. I have performed from small meetups to large events focusing on the themes of developing web solutions. I also share knowledge on my [blog](https://alvarocamillont.dev/), participate in the organization of [AngularSP](https://www.meetup.com/pt-BR/AngularJS-Sao-Paulo/) and also in the [Totvs Developers community](https://developers.totvs.com/).
